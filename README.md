In this project, I have used the following tags. Here is an explaination of each of them:

# 1. Header
Header is used to create a Title to the page. It runs from left to right.
The following tags are used for a Header:
```html
<header></header>
```
Example:
```html
<header> This is my Page Header </header>
```
# 2. Section
A section tag is used to define a particular section of the page, you can add multiple tags inside a section.
The following tags are used for a section:
```html
<section> </section>
```
Example:
```html
<section>
    <label>This is a label inside the section tag</label>
    <h1>This is a h1 tag inside the section tag</h1>
</section>
```
